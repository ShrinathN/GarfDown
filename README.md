# GarfDown
A simple comic strip downloader for a certain orange colored canine
Usage is pretty simple, just enter the date, month, and year to start the downloads from, and it will download every comic strip from that date to present.

./gar.sh [date] [month] [year]

First strip was released on June 19, 1978, so you can run the script as...

./gar.sh 19 6 1978

...to download every comic strip in existance. It will automatically stop once it reaches present.
